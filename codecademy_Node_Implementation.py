# Node Implementation
# Letâ€™s implement a linked list in Python. As you might recall, 
# each linked list is a sequential chain of nodes. So before we start building out the LinkedList itself, we want to build up a Node class in Python that we can use to build our data containers.
# Remember that a node contains two elements:
# data
# a link to the next node

# 1.    Within script.py in the pane to the right, create an empty Node class.
#       Inside, define an __init__() method for the Node. It should take a value and a next_node.
#       next_node should default to None if not provided. These variables should be saved to self 
#       with corresponding key names.

# 2.    Define .get_value() and .get_next_node() methods. These should return the corresponding values
#       from self.

# 3.    Define a .set_next_node() method that takes self and next_node as parameters and allows you to
#       update the link to the next node.

# 4.    Outside the Node class, create an instance of Node called my_node with a value of 44.
#       Use .get_value() to print the value of my_node.

# Define your Node class below:
class Node:
    def __init__(self,value,next_node=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next_node = next_node
    
    # Part-2
    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

    def get_next_node(self):
        return self.next_node

    #Part-3
    def set_next_node(self,next_node):
        self.next_node = next_node

#Part-4
my_node = Node(44)
print(my_node.get_value())
