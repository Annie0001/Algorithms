#   In Python we donâ€™t have an array data structure that uses a contiguous block of memory. 
#   We are going to simulate an array by creating a list and keeping track of the size of the list
#   with an additional integer variable. This will allow us to design something that resembles a hash map. 

#   1- Create a class called HashMap.
#   2- Give HashMap a constructor which takes both self and array_size as parameters.
#      .array_size should be assigned to an instance variable of the same name (.array_size), and represents the size of the array.
#   3- Create an instance variable called .array, which is a list of size array_size. Make each element of .array equal to None.

class HashMap:
    def __init__(self,array_size):
        self.array_size = array_size
        self.array = [None for i in range(self.array_size)]
