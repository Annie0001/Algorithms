# 1-  To start our exploration into OOP, create a class that will represent an employee of a company.
# In script.py:
# Define a class called Employee
# Define a class variable new_id and set it equal to 1

# 2-  Each Employee instance will need its own unique ID.
# Inside the Employee class:
# Define an __init__() method
# Inside __init__(), define self.id and set it equal to the class variable new_id
# Lastly, increment new_id by 1 

# 3-  Now create a function to output the instance id.
# Inside the Employee class:
# Define a say_id() method
# Inside say_id(), output the string "My id is " and then the instance id.
